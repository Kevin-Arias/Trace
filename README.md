# Trace

I fully designed and developed a mobile application through Android Studio that tracks user input to analyze the user's levels of stress over time and resolve possible causes of stress for users. 

Here is a link to a video showing the application in use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67x6Zfm0Q4M&t=10s
 
Here, we see under the “History” tab that there is a fully functioning calendar. The blue colored date would represent today’s date. Users can quickly gather information about past panic or stress related attacks or notes using the clearly marked icons that populate the calendar. The “heart” icon would represent if the user had a panic attack that day while the “note” icon represents a note that the user recorded.

When the user selects a certain day, the note (if there is a note) will show up on the bottom of the calendar, as shown here. We see that the date of the note is 11/14, the trigger is “Relationships”, and the severity of the attack is “0.9” out of 1. The note attached to that day’s log is shown.

</p>

Here, we see another instance of the user selecting a date, 11/2, and seeing the corresponding note at the bottom.

</p>

This is also the user flow for the calendar. The user is able to go through all the months in the calendar using these left and right buttons. As shown, there are currently no notes or recorded data for December. At the bottom, the default note view is shown. The plus button at the bottom right allows the user to add new notes to selected dates if needed.

</p>

Here we can see other task screens that are part of the application. One of the functionalities is the user being prompted after a panic attack to fill out a series of questions. These are some of the screens used intended for “user logging”.

The first screen that shows up is the “severity” screen. Here is where the user can self-report how stressed they feel as a percentage. This is up to the user to determine how stressed they are since every individual is different. Tabs are at the bottom so that the user can tap between the three screens and the current screen is highlighted.

</p>


The second screen in the flow is the “cause” screen. Here, the user can input their own triggers and old triggers will be saved and displayed for easy access next time it causes an attack. When the plus button is pressed, the dialog on the right will pop up, prompting user entry.

</p>

The last screen in the “log” user flow is the “note” frame. Here, the user can leave a note regarding the panic attack that just happened. This note and all the previous data will be stored in the app and is accessible to view in the calendar task/frame (as shown before).

</p>

The third task is the graph/report generation. Here the user can visually see his logged amounts of stress over time.
